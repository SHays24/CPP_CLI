# A CLI scaffold program written in C++
## A Poorly written first-ish attempt at C++

idk, it sort of works, but definitely needs refinement.
command processor class holds the basics of coand matching, argument separation is the responsibility of the executed function (for generic applicability)
---
## To Do
- write an argument segmenter method, in the sake of optimization
- implement some basic functions
- actually properly migrate to OOP from the franken-oriented programming that was written in a state of boredom and out of many stackoverflow answers on the web.
